# Case Studies â€“ Encryption Basics

## Case Study 1: Secure Web Communication
- Topic: HTTPS & SSL/TLS
- Problem: Sensitive data intercepted during transmission
- Solution: Implemented SSL/TLS with asymmetric encryption for key exchange and symmetric encryption for data
- Outcome: Data confidentiality and integrity ensured

## Case Study 2: Digital Signatures in Software Distribution
- Topic: Ensuring authenticity of software
- Problem: Malware injection in software packages
- Solution: Signed software binaries with digital signatures
- Outcome: Users could verify integrity before installation

## Case Study 3: Hashing for Password Storage
- Topic: Protecting user credentials
- Problem: Database breach exposing plaintext passwords
- Solution: Stored passwords using SHA-256 hashing with salt
- Outcome: Reduced risk of credential theft
